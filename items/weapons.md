## Slashing

* [a bastard sword](#a-bastard-sword)
* [a steel scimitar](#a-steel-scimitar)

### a bastard sword

> This sword, consists of a four foot long, straight, double-edged blade and
> an elongated handle. The blade is quite heavy, thus the need for an elongated
> handle which allows the wielder to add two or three fingers from the off-hand,
> placed on the pommel, to wield the sword with a hand-and-a-half. The bastard
> sword represents a compromise between the slow and bulky true two-handed and
> great swords whilst giving the wielder more potential to inflict damage than a
> conventional one-handed sword.

### a steel scimitar

> This heavy, single-edged curved bladed sword is a fierce weapon in the
> hands of a strong and well trained warrior. The curvature on the blade is

> lacks the defensive qualities of a more conventional, straight double-egded
> sword.
